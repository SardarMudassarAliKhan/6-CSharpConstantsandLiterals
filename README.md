In C#, constants and literals play important roles in programming. Let's define each term and discuss their usage:

1. **Constants**:
   - Constants are values that do not change during the execution of a program.
   - They are declared using the `const` keyword.
   - Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration.
   - Constants are implicitly static, meaning they belong to the type rather than to instances of the type.
   - Constants are typically used for values that are known at compile time and are not expected to change.

Example of declaring a constant in C#:
```csharp
public class ConstantsExample
{
    public const int MaxValue = 100;
    public const string ApplicationName = "MyApp";
}
```

2. **Literals**:
   - Literals are explicit values used in code.
   - They represent fixed values that are not calculated but directly written into the code.
   - Common literals include numbers, characters, strings, and Boolean values.
   - Literals can be of different types, such as integer literals, floating-point literals, character literals, string literals, boolean literals, and null literals.

Examples of literals in C#:
```csharp
int number = 10;           // Integer literal
double pi = 3.14;          // Floating-point literal
char letter = 'A';         // Character literal
string message = "Hello";  // String literal
bool isTrue = true;        // Boolean literal
object obj = null;         // Null literal
```

Constants are used for values that remain constant throughout the program, while literals are explicit values used directly in code to represent fixed values of different types.
